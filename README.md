 to guide me in coding the banner for my website, which helped me understand the structure and styling needed. To visualize my design before implementing it on the actual site, I experimented with CodePen
, allowing me to test and adjust my code in real-time. Additionally, I watched this video
 to learn how to style my website for different screen sizes, helping me make my design responsive and adaptable to various devices.
