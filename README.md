I used this YouTube tutorial
 to guide me in coding the banner for my website, which helped me understand the structure and styling needed. To visualize my design before implementing it on the actual site, I experimented with CodePen
, allowing me to test and adjust my code in real-time. Additionally, I watched this video
 to learn how to style my website for different screen sizes, helping me make my design responsive and adaptable to various devices.
